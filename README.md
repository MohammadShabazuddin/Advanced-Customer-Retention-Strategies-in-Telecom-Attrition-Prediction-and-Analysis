## Introduction

The telecommunications sector is essential to the global economy, providing various services from voice calls to internet services. Customer retention is crucial due to intense competition and high acquisition costs.

## Objectives

- Develop a high-accuracy predictive model for customer attrition.
- Identify key factors contributing to customer turnover.
- Formulate targeted retention strategies based on model insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Clean and transform customer data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and create influential features.
3. **Model Development and Training**: Train models on historical data.
4. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Use SMOTE to balance the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Assess models using various metrics.
6. **Deployment and Integration**: Implement the model within the telecom operator's system.
7. **Result Interpretation**: Use predictions to inform retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, billing history, and interactions, with 7,043 entries and 21 columns.

## Model Building

Develop and train models such as Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost for attrition prediction. Optimize parameters to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Results and Conclusion

- **With SMOTE**: Improved recall, better identification of high-risk customers.
- **Feature Importance**: Key factors include tenure, total charges, and contract type.
